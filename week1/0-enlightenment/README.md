# Enlightenment

> The Koans walk you along the path to enlightenment in order to learn Ruby.
> The goal is to learn the Ruby language, syntax, structure, and some common
> functions and libraries. We also teach you culture. Testing is not just
> something we pay lip service to, but something we live. It is essential in
> your quest to learn and do great things in the language.

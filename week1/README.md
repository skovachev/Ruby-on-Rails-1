# Week 1

Hello, and welcome to the first week of our humble little Ruby on Rails class.

![RUBYYYY](https://raw.github.com/HackBulgaria/Ruby-On-Rails-1/master/week1/.ruby.jpg)

## Setup

Installing [Ruby 2.2] or [Rails 4.2], isn't newbie friendly. Here are our tips
on how to install it on your favourite OS.

### Windows

The easiest way to get [Ruby 2.2] on Windows is this [Ruby Installer][]. Don't
forget to add the `C:\Ruby-221\bin` to the beginning of `%PATH%`.
[Here][Windows Path] is how to do it.

Alternatively, you can use [Rails Installer][] and bundle a [Rails 4.2]
application.

### Linux & OSX

Follow the instructions on [rbenv installation page][]. After rbenv is
installed, run the following in a fresh terminal session.

```bash
rbenv install 2.2.1 && rbenv global 2.2.1
gem install rails
```

## Problems

- [Ruby Koans][]: If you think your Ruby is really rusty.
- [Sparse Matrix][]: If you can accept the algorhitmic challenge.
